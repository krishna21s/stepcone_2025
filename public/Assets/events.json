In this event, participants operate a remote-controlled hovercraft to race on both land and water. The hovercraft must meet specific design requirements, including dimensions (length: 25cm to 40cm, width: 14cm to 26cm) and the ability to float on water at a depth of 0.4 meters. The hovercraft should be powered by DC 360 motors and run on a 9V or 12V rechargeable battery. Teams can use any materials to create their hovercraft, and the control can be done via a mobile or remote controller.The event takes place over two days with three rounds of racing. The first round, Fastest Hovercraft First, tests speed and maneuverability on both land and water. The second round, Intermediate Race, is similar to the first, where the fastest hovercrafts advance to the final round. The third round, The Floating Objects, presents a challenging race with obstacles on both land and water. Judging criteria include design compliance, control and maneuverability, speed and efficiency, obstacle navigation, and teamwork. The expected number of participants is 120, and the registration fee is 2000. The top teams can win prizes of up to 12000 for first place and 8000 for second place.",

The event encourages innovation and engineering skills as teams build robots that can navigate a racecourse with various obstacles. Each team must meet specific guidelines to ensure their robot adheres to the event's requirements. These include restrictions on the bot's mobility and design, such as no suction cups, diaphragms, or sticky devices. Additionally, the robot must be controlled through a wireless remote using either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi modules, with an onboard power supply and no external power sources.The event consists of two rounds: The first round serves as a basic testing phase where the bots are evaluated based on their design and accuracy. In the second round, the robots compete on a race track filled with different levels of traps. The goal is for each robot to navigate through the obstacles and reach the finish line in the shortest time possible while avoiding errors. The judging criteria focus on the bot's design, speed, accuracy, and ability to handle the challenges of the race track.The event is scheduled for a 4-hour day-shift duration, with a registration fee of Rs 1000 per team. The top-performing teams will be awarded cash prizes, with the first prize being Rs 12000 and the second prize Rs 8000.

This event challenges participants to demonstrate their understanding of algorithms, data structures, and best programming practices while working within time constraints. It encourages participants to think critically, solve problems efficiently, and enhance their technical skills by reworking code to improve its quality.",

Teams begin with a QR Code Hunt and Jigsaw Puzzle Assembly, where they use clues to collect puzzle pieces and assemble them into a complete image. Advancing teams then take on the Structure Building Round, recreating the image from the puzzle using provided materials, with accuracy and speed determining their progression.In the Memory Challenge and Balloon Burst, participants briefly view an image, then recreate it from memory while completing a balloon-bursting task, adding an element of physical fun. The final round, Bottle-Flipping and Structure Modification, combines skill and strategy as teams compete in a bottle-flipping game to earn the ability to enhance their own structures or sabotage their opponents. The event culminates in a showdown where the team with the most intact and well-built structure emerges victorious.With exciting prizes, a vibrant atmosphere, and activities designed to challenge both the mind and body, TTT promises to be an unforgettable experience for participants and spectators alike!",
